During the last ten days, two more came from America--Nathan and Jack. \r<br />\r<br />We were returning from our trip north, and as we walked through the darkness of the field towards the orphanage's rec center lights, I could hear the shouts of the kids. We crept up the steps, trying to sneak up on them, but Muney saw one of us and shouted and we were swept up in a tide of adoring, wriggling kids, saying, \"Enna (older brother) we thought you go to America. Enna come back, good.\"\r<br />\r<br />I looked over the heads of the kids and saw Nathan and Jack standing there, smiling. It seemed wrong to me that they were there--and I struggled to hide it from them as they came over to hug us and talk excitedly about the two days they'd been with the kids while we'd been gone. They kept telling us things we already knew. And I started getting annoyed, and for an instant I wondered if the kids liked them more than they liked me. I thought, <i>well, I'm not much of a kid person, anyway</i> and immediately upon thinking that Vignesh come up to me, threw his arms around my waist, pressing the side of his face against me. \"I missed you so much\" he said. \r<br />\r<br />A harsh light was thrown on me. I saw how petty and small I was being. I was afraid somebody would see written on my face how scared I was that the kids had forgotten us, afraid that the beginnings of love they had shown would have withered in our absence. \r<br />\r<br />And that was the case so many times. The honesty of the children humbled me, humiliated me even. I couldn't stand to look them in the eyes, sometimes, for fear of what they would see in mine. But they never looked away.\r<br />\r<br />I was reading the famous Corinthian love verses recently--\"Love is not jealous or boastful or proud\" (1 Corinthians 13:4)--and this is what I realized: that there will always be a mean, insecure, jealous voice inside of me. It's dumb to expect otherwise, in this world. Even when Vignesh hugged me, it did not go away, it didn't even get quiet; it was simply that love roared up in me, strong as an army, until I couldn't hear that stupid, fearful voice anymore.\r<br />\r<br />Silas",

Lazy people sit around eating Doritos and playing video games and don't have jobs. I've had jobs. I keep busy. I stay involved. At least I used to before I moved from the big city of Chicago to a suburb in Northeast Ohio.\r<br />\r<br />For some reason it's harder now for me to call people or even get to the doctor's office. I feel lethargic. I'm frustrated. What changed? Where did my energy go?\r<br />\r<br />I wanted God to tell me how to find that passion again and something made me start reading through Proverbs about laziness. I began to realize everything that kept me busy in the past didn't require that much of me. As many activities and friends as I had, I didn't have to go out of my way to gain any of it. And now that I do, I find myself unwilling.\r<br />\r<br />I'm sure some Winnie the Pooh book or Berenstain Bears movie told me this once; that nothing good comes easily. It goes two ways: anything worthwhile is worth working for and anything not worthwhile...well, probably isn't very rewarding.\r<br />\r<br />So when I think about my sickly friendships, I'm starting to feel like I should just call Carly instead of whining about feeling far away from her. When I feel useless maybe I should just go to the food bank, instead of crying over my lack of motivation. \r<br />\r<br /><i>\"Despite their desires, the lazy will come to ruin, for their hands refuse to work\" </i>(Proverbs 21:25).\r<br />\r<br />Come on hands, let's go.\r<br />\r<br />June",

And then have it written down in the best-selling book of all time.\r<br />\r<br />One of my favorites is in Mark 9 (and then exactly one chapter later in Mark 10) when their response to Jesus saying, \"I'm going to be killed soon\" is to call \"shotgun\" to sit in the front seat of the kingdom.\r<br />\r<br />The first time, at least, they had the decency to be embarrassed at arguing over who was the greatest like a bunch of middle school basketball players.

And I'm no apostle destined to die for my faith.\r<br />\r<br />So is it still funny that my frail, clumsy, narcissistic humanity shows up just as obvious and ugly? Would a biographer make comic hay of the way I jockey with my wife over who does dishes or spends most or admits guilt first?\r<br />\r<br />Apparently, on many days, I do not want to be first, even in my own house, if that means being last in my own house.\r<br />\r<br />That's hilarious, right?\r<br />\r<br />Hank",

It's written to exiles in Babylon. After God promised them a future in which they wouldn't be exiles, he told them to settle in, plant crops, have children and to \"work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile.\"\r<br />\r<br />I love that.

Mike said the persecution of Christians is alive and well in America. Adam said that the term \"persecution\" must be stretched mighty thin to apply to America's treatment of Christianity. Mike said Adam was apathetic, holding the cross in contempt. Adam responded: \"wow.\"\r<br />\r<br />It was heated in the way online conversations are heated: blustery, self-righteous, and over as soon as both sides ran out of vocabulary. A short, sad, stupid story. Except, I happen to know a little background.\r<br />\r<br />Adam was once a Christian. Or, sort of still is, or something. He's not too sure himself, and I won't put words in his mouth. I remember a few months when he let me live with him when I had no place to stay. He'd pace the floor, debating himself out loud. He wanted to believe but couldn't rationalize it. We can sympathize, many of us.\r<br />\r<br />Christians themselves, most of them, didn't help much. When he was still certain of his Christianity but open about his struggles, some told him that he couldn't possibly be a Christian if he was still doubting. And now, some years later, those barbs seem to have nearly convinced him.\r<br />\r<br />After the Facebook fight had smoldered down to a smoking pile, he said \"I'd be lying if I said this stuff never hurt.\" I know what kind of stuff he's talking about. We have become adept in dressing cruel sentiments in flowery Christian words. The whole Bible, reduced to a series of talking points for our next argument.\r<br />\r<br />And I thought to myself, whatever persecution there is of Christians in this country cannot be nearly as damaging as persecution by Christians in this country. \r<br /><i>\r<br />\"Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love come from God.

Levy that I would rise up and kill in the night like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%204:14-21&amp;version=NLT\">Jael</a>. And I would. I would kill this thing.

But I could not.\r\rShe flipped her body. Facing me.

People say we look alike, but to me the differences are glaring. Her clothes are two sizes smaller. Her bra is two sizes larger. Her hair is at least three inches longer. Her tan is several shades darker. Besides that she has an interesting career and models on the side.\r<br />\r<br />She came from Omaha to see me in Dallas this weekend, and I was once again stunned at how her looks seem to improve as she ages. My old fears of being seen as the lesser copy of the perfect original came back as I introduced her to my circle of friends at a barbeque. I was sure they would start comparing and see that I wasn't as beautiful or interesting as she is. I felt myself beginning to shrink as my little-sister-complex grew.\r<br />\r<br />Ecclesiastes has a way of making sense of things that don't make sense, by simply saying everything is \"like chasing after wind.\" The solution to this futility is to \"accept your lot in life\" and enjoy what you have. Ecclesiastes 9:6-7 says, <i>\"Whatever</i> [people] <i>did in their lifetime--loving, hating, envying--is all long gone...So go ahead. Eat your food and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God approves of this.\" </i>So the time I spend envying will only keep me from enjoying, and God approves of my enjoyment. So envy disappoints God because he knows it keeps me from joy.\r<br />\r<br />The night of the barbeque, my friends engaged me as much as usual. When I talked with them, I didn't see the expected disappointment in their eyes. I realized I was the only one comparing my sister and myself. I started to relax and enjoy. In the end, I had a great night. Would have been a shame to miss it because of envy.\r<br />\r<br />Ellen",

At least.\" And I knew that was completely false, simply because, well, I couldn't imagine any woman wanting to have sex six times a day with these guys. Just didn't seem likely.\r<br />\r<br />But wanting an orgasm and wanting sex aren't the same thing. I may very well want an orgasm six times a day, but in my marriage, I found sex to be an extremely vulnerable, emotionally intimidating and overall exhausting activity. \r<br />\r<br />And I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was. My sexual experiences up to the point of my marriage consisted of pornography, masturbation and guilty back-seat fondling with girlfriends. Everything was focused on my God-given and quickly distorted desire to have an orgasm. \r<br />\r<br />But in marriage, sex isn't just the reward, it's part of the work. Sex is a point of union, and there are times when you don't want to talk to your spouse, let alone make love to her. The Biblical requisite to have sex seemed unnecessary before I was married, but now I see its importance. Sex is often sacrificial, and that's not what I wanted it to be. \r<br />\r<br />So I'm working on this one: \"husbands...love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her...\" (Ephesians 5:25).  As my wife and I work to grow closer sexually, I see the fruit of that work--a mysterious, blossoming oneness.*\r<br />\r<br />And for those of you who aren't married, don't think that your potential spouse is going to be the thing you've been fantasizing about. \r<br />\r<br />She'll be something better. Something real. Something worth working for. \r<br />\r<br />Sam\r<br />\r<br />* \"This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one. Now the man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame\" (Genesis 2:24-25).",

We won’t make it!\"\r<br />\r<br />\"Courage, boy!\" he said, his voice deep and gravelly. \"Can't you see I've already saved you?\"\r<br />\r<br />And I looked and saw that he had nailed his feet to the deck and his hands to the wheel.\r<br />\r<br />\"Besides,\" he said, with a great laugh, \"this is how the ocean is supposed to be.

Because I was two years behind her, I was always learning what she already knew. When I made the varsity volleyball team, she was captain and that scenario repeated itself all through my adolescence. I felt behind and little most of the time. That, plus the fact that she’s beautiful and elegant, bred in me a deep sense of jealousy. \r<br />\r<br />The ugliest part of jealousy is that it makes you unable to celebrate with whomever you're jealous of. You can't be happy for them because you're too busy feeling behind in the competition you've created. In my relationship with my sister, it also blinded me to her pain. As we became adults, my jealousy became emotional distance. We talked often, but I kept a \"safe\" self-protective space between us.\r<br />\r<br />A few years ago, my sister decided to file for divorce after eight years of marriage. Those eight years were filled with painful emotional abuse, difficult fertility treatments, a miscarriage and lots of hard work. One night shortly after the divorce we were talking, and I saw all of that. I saw her pain, and I cried with her. Something in me loosened that night. All of my resentment at what I saw as her superiority unraveled. I realized the pain she had been carrying by herself while I begrudged her happiness.\r<br />\r<br />Romans chapter 12 talks about how to fully experience life as the body of Christ. Verse 15 says, \"Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep.\" Jealousy made that impossible for me. It took seeing and sharing my sister's sadness to make me capable of desiring happiness for her.\r<br />\r<br />Ellen",

Too tired to get up but too freaked out to lose consciousness again, my bed felt like a prison. How was I going to tell my wife I didn't get this job, either?

And fear. Maybe both.)\r<br />\r<br />His next choice is to make it a song: <i>\"My soul is in anguish. How long, LORD, how long?\"</i> He didn't hold back. He put his ugly fears and feelings right out there.\r<br />\r<br />And then he believed: <i>\"The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.\"</i>\r<br />\r<br />Will I believe him before I see how he'll fix it? I want to.\r<br />\r<br />It's not a magic potion, but it makes it a little easier for me somehow to mumble through Psalm 6 with David in the darkness, a little less frantic in my stupid bed.

I will make a helper who is just right for him\" (Genesis 2:18).\r<br />\r<br />Marriage is the slow deconstruction and reassembling of two human beings who were made to fit together but don't even come close any more.

Our anger, our bitterness, our addictions, our judgmental hearts and lies have to be drawn out into the open, understood and disassembled. \r<br />\r<br />It's no wonder that failure is the rule.

All told, more damage may be done than good within marriages, but the potential for healing--for true, lasting healing--is more potent than I could ever have imagined.

      "content": "A pair of police lights spiraled in the rearview mirror.\r<br />\r<br />Kate pulled over, and in the passenger seat, Stephanie buckled her seatbelt. In the back, my roommate and I wiped the smiles off our faces, did our best to look like polite young men. The officer walked towards us, flashlight in hand. Kate rolled down the window, he poked his head in, and the mood instantly went from tense to...something else.\r<br />\r<br />He was perfect. Even from the backseat I could tell that. Muscular, tan, broad-shouldered, with a firm jaw ever-so-slightly stubbled. He peered through the open window into the car with a charming, confident smile.\r<br />\r<br />\"Pardon me, ladies,\" he said, tipping his cap to them with nary a look at us two guys in the backseat. \"Just thought you should know you have a tail light out.\"\r<br />\r<br />Kate and Stephanie couldn't seem to find words kind enough to express their full gratitude.\r<br />\r<br />And, in that moment, I desperately wanted something to be wrong with that cop. I wanted him to be financially unlucky, a slow reader, stupid tattoos--anything. I had to imagine superiority in some area. \"Anger is cruel and wrath is like a flood,\" says Proverbs 27:4, \"but jealousy is even more dangerous.\" Dangerous, perhaps, because of its subtle strength. One minute, you're noticing the expensive car or gorgeous wife. The next, there's a burning mess of ill-will in your brain, all because someone else is better.\r<br />\r<br />Maybe that's all jealousy is. The feeling we get whenever our superiority is threatened.\r<br />\r<br />The cop left, and Kate rolled up her window. \"He was,\" Stephanie paused, looking for the right word. \"Good-looking,\" she finally finished with upraised eyebrows.\r<br />\r<br />We walk through life with understood areas of control, little domains in which we are chief. We guard them with our egos, and only surrender them bitterly. We feel jealous only because we want to be better. And maybe we could stave off this rage, this bitterest of stains, with only a little more thought to Jesus' most famous words.\r<br />\r<br />\"God blesses those who are humble, for they will inherit the whole earth\" (Matthew 5:5).\r<br />\r<br />Joe",

It was my brother she betrayed: lying, cheating, diving in wholeheartedly to an affair and torching her marriage without a glance backward.\r<br />\r<br />How many hours had I listened and comforted and cried with my brother as his heart and life were gutted?

Hey, haven't seen you since you started having sex with that other married man. How's that working out for you?\r<br />\r<br />Processing my encounter later I realized how mad I still was.

She's more than her mistakes--just like I hope I am. I don't have to like what she did, but I have to choose to leave it between her and God.\r<br />\r<br />\"Then Peter came to him and asked, \"Lord, how often should I forgive someone who sins against me?

I heard it very early one morning in India, when I thought I was alone. \r<br />\r<br />Yesterday, I found a two-minute sound clip (play audio above) of the India jungle as it wakes in the morning. The sheer diversity of the bird calls is dumbfounding. There are a hundred unique threads being woven, from the liquid bright calls of the small birds to the harsher caws of the red-winged black bird, and yet all together they sound beautiful; a complex tapestry sewn in the air each morning.\r<br />\r<br />My dad always says, excitedly, as he shows me an amethyst crystal or an agate, \"It doesn't have to be like this.\" And he says it when he talks about the stars up at the cabin.\r<br />\r<br />In the first chapter of Brennan Manning's The Ragamuffin Gospel, he talks about the problem with the American idea of worthiness. Sayings like, \"You get what you pay for\" showcase a philosophy that has no room for mercy or for grace. He also had me thinking about what my dad says as he steps out the door in the morning: \"It doesn't have to be like this.\"\r<br />\r<br />\"For God has saved us and called us to a holy life. He did this, not because we deserved it, but because that was his plan from before the beginning of time--to show us his grace through Christ Jesus\" (2 Timothy 1:9).\r<br />\r<br />It doesn't have to be beautiful, but it is. And none of us does anything to earn the beauty that is poured down on us from summer skies.\r<br />\r<br />There's something to be learned about grace there, something to be learned about an ancient Kingdom in the unnecessary beauty of the bird songs in India.\r<br />\r<br />Silas",

Sometimes church can feel like it's built for the Women and Kids demographic, with all of the emphasis on feelings and relationships and simplified Bible stories.\r<br />\r<br />But Hebrews 12 is tough. It says God expects me to do hard things: You've got a mission. Ditch anything that slows you down--and keep going.\r<br />\r<br />By the way, it says, God's going to discipline me like a good Father. He's going to bring some hardship my way to keep my head in the game, to make me stronger, to make me want to shake loose of sin. I might bleed. \r<br />\r<br />Don't take it as betrayal, man, take it as love.\r<br />\r<br />Then this in verses 12-13, after the discipline: \"So take a new grip with your tired hands and strengthen your weak knees. Mark out a straight path for your feet so that those who are weak and lame will not fall but become strong.\"\r<br />\r<br />Yeah, you're tired, but you're not done, yet. Keep going. It matters. And he's given you everything you need to get the job done.\r<br />\r<br />I dig the idea that God wants me to cowboy up. It makes me want to give him all I've got, to not hold anything back. It makes me want to be a man.\r<br />\r<br />Read the chapter. You'll see what I mean.\r<br />\r<br />Hank",

We disagree about a lot of things philosophically, politically and spiritually but have always managed to not let those disagreements get in the way of our relationship. Last year, though, she took a stand over a political issue. She wanted me to contribute money to an organization that she supports but that I feel goes against some of God's most basic principles. When I said \"no\", she flew off the handle and cut me out of her life.\r<br />\r<br />At first I was sad and sympathetic. As time went on, though, I got mad and then progressed to bitter and now have comfortably settled into a simmering mess of self-righteous anger and unforgiving pouting. It's not a good place to be and I know this, but I've drawn my hurt around me like a blanket and here I sit. At this point, I don't know how I would react if she approached me. Not well, I'm afraid.\r<br />\r<br />I know better. I really, really do. But I can't seem to help myself. This morning, though, I read \"Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.\" That does not describe me or my feelings about my sister whom I say I love.\r<br />\r<br />Also, \"When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things\" (1 Corinthians 13:11). If sitting in a simmering stew of pouting bitterness is not childish, I don't know what is. It's time to grow up.\r<br />\r<br />Darn it. I hate this. I hate that I have to give up these feelings that I think I'm entitled to. I hate that I'm going to have to pray long and hard and ask God to help me forgive and behave lovingly.

One of Saul's lead officers, Doeg, says he saw the priest Ahimelech feeding David and praying for him. Saul sends for Ahimelech and his fellow priests:\r<br />\r<br />\"'Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me?'...\r<br />\r<br />'Why did you give him food and a sword? Why have you consulted God for him? Why have you encouraged him to kill me, as he is trying to do this very day?'\"\r<br />\r<br />Ahimelech respectfully defends David's loyalty and assures Saul there is no plot on his life.\r<br />\r<br />So Saul kills him. Ahimelech and the eighty-four priests with him, all still in their priestly garments--dead. Then Doeg goes into the priests' hometown and slaughters all their men, women, children and babies.\r<br />\r<br />When I first read this, I was appalled. But it scares me how much I see of myself in this story. I remember the unsteadiness I feel when giving solace to my prejudices. I like to say I'm standing for justice, that I'm only upset because of sin. But there's a reason God tells us to leave justice up to him. It's like all those other stories of people consumed by their revenge or their greed--they never know peace. But this isn't the lot of a person who's surrendered to God.\r<br />\r<br />In the beginning of the story, Saul is sitting under a tree, surrounded by his military--holding his spear. Sometimes I feel like that's what I'm doing. Tempting my mind with sharp words and accusations against others. Thinking I can dwell on these things while remaining devoted to God. I don't realize how easily those thoughts can cut into my veins. That I'm really not that far away from being like Saul.\r<br />\r<br />\"If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall. The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful...When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure\" (1 Corinthians 10).\r<br />\r<br />I guess the question is more like: Do I want a way out?\r<br />\r<br />June",

I was, apparently, in charge of coordinating all of our schedules.\r<br />\r<br />In hindsight, this was probably where the problems began. Emily ended up getting crazy frustrated with me because I couldn't remember to call her every time the plans changed. I wish I could explain the whole situation, but I'm not trying to vent here. Suffice it to say, she was a little annoyed with me and I with her.\r<br />\r<br />Then, two days later, I said to my husband, \"Want to go over to Bryce and Emily's?\" I was excited. I wanted to see them. I'd forgotten that the last time I saw Emily we were avoiding eye contact. As we were driving over to their house, I suddenly remembered. And I got fiery. All I can think about was how unreasonable and unfair she was. How much she hurt my feelings.\r<br />\r<br />There's this pithy saying in Romans 12 that I've always found particularly witty and yet surprisingly unhelpful:<i> \"Don't just pretend to love others. Really love them\"</i> (12:9).\r<br />\r<br />It's followed by some verses that I never really understood the connection to before now.\r<br />\r<br />\"Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring each other.\r<br />...Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying.\r<br />...Live in harmony with each other... And don't think you know it all!\r<br />Never pay back evil with more evil... Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.\r<br />...Don't let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.\"\r<br />\r<br />I'd like to say that when I got to Emily's, I kept my mouth shut. But I didn't. I tried to explain the Chipotle disaster to her. She only repeated her frustrated sentiments from two nights before. I sighed at her a little bit, as I'm sure she did at me. And then we happily moved on. Because some things just aren't worth fighting over.\r<br />\r<br />June",

Anne said she was most afraid of their sin.\r<br />\r<br />She was afraid she'd spend all these years raising and teaching her kids, only to have them attach themselves to something destructive. It still scares her to this day. And I don't blame her. We want our loved ones, especially our children, to be protected from all the things that hurt us. We don't want them making the same mistakes.\r<br />\r<br />Maybe this is what bothered me so much the other day, when I read David's Song of Deliverance:\r<br />\r<br />\"For I have kept the ways of the Lord;\r<br />      I have not turned from my God to follow evil.\r<br />I have followed all his regulations;\r<br />      I have never abandoned his decrees.\r<br />I am blameless before God;\r<br />      I have kept myself from sin\" (2 Samuel 22:22-24).\r<br />\r<br />What is he talking about!? Who can honestly say those things? And David of all people! It seemed so bold and naive. Here I was, thinking about how to overcome my anxiety about hurting the people I love most, and there's David, saying he's awesome. Saying things I knew weren't true.\r<br />\r<br />\"To the faithful you show yourself faithful;\r<br />    to those with integrity you show integrity.\r<br />To the pure you show yourself pure\" (Psalm 18:25-26)\r<br />\r<br />I fought with this in my head for a while. I even fought about it with my husband. God changed David's heart. He was a new man. And here he praises God for that. David isn't being arrogant or naive. He knows he messed up. But he also knew that God was just. And that a pure heart would not go unnoticed.\r<br />\r<br />We can't protect the people we love. We can't stop them from making our mistakes. But we can teach them how to deal with those mistakes. We can show them what it looks like to be someone who knows when they're wrong. Maybe being a mature Christian has more to do with thanking God for helping us grow, in spite of ourselves.\r<br />\r<br />June",

I hear it from pastors all the time: \"No one can fill the void in your soul, except for Jesus!\" I read it in Mark 8:36, \"And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?\" But, here's the simple truth: I'm generally trying to hang onto my soul while still gaining the whole world. I'm shuffling around my soul's furniture to make room for Jesus plus whoever else can be squeezed in.\r<br />\r<br />But the thing is, when Jesus can get me alone--lonely, insecure, scared, hurt, and angry--it's when he has me there that we're really getting somewhere. Because if his 'power works best in weakness' (2 Corinthians 12:9), then there's something to be said for seeking out loneliness.

While I'm gone, I need you to make 50 copies of the Daniel's Report, and buy me a case of Sprite for my little refrigerator.\"\r<br />\r<br />This is sort of what Jesus did. He died on the cross, rose from the dead, and then ascended to heaven. But before he left, he gave us an assignment.\r<br />\r<br />Matthew 28:16-20\r<br /> \r<br /><i>Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him--but some of them doubted!\r<br /> \r<br />Jesus came and told his disciples, \"I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\"</i>\r<br />\r<br />So his assignment: Make disciples. He told this to his disciples, \"Hey disciples, go do what I did, but with other people.\" And you may be listening to this as a current disciple of Jesus because those guys did their job way back in the day. And so it continues. The task falls to you. Who are you discipling right now?",

There is more than enough room in my Father's home. If this were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? When everything is ready, I will come and get you, so that you will always be with me where I am.\"\r<br />\r<br />That passage starts off with one simple phrase: don't be troubled. Jesus said this to his friends right before he was arrested and killed. Seems like a lot to ask, doesn't it, to trust him when the worst was about to happen? But he did ask for their trust, and he asks us for the same. Trust in Jesus and hope will follow. It's that simple. So take comfort and don't be troubled.",

I can even prepare a lecture in my mind detailing all the ways he needs to change.\r<br />\r<br />God is a multi-tasker, too. He can watch me do all that, listen to my litany of complaints AND bonk me over the head with the truth without even breaking a sweat. And the truth is this: I can't change my husband. I can only change my attitude.\r<br />\r<br />My big a-ha moment while vacuuming came when I realized that my list of complaints about my husband was the same list I'd been going over for my entire marriage. In fact, it's the same list I had before we got married. Which meant that on the day I said \"I do\", I did so knowing his faults--and I committed my life to him anyway.\r<br />\r<br />It suddenly occurred to me that day that it was pretty unfair to expect him to live up to my standards when I had promised to love and cherish him knowing he wasn't perfect. If I had remembered at my wedding ceremony when they read 1 Corinthians I would have already known that. <i>\"[Love] does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged.\" </i>(13:5-6)\r<br />\r<br />Boy had I blown that one. At times I had very nearly developed a \"my way or the highway\" attitude. I'd definitely been irritable. In fact, irritable is putting it nicely. And the record of his wrongs was lengthy and detailed.\r<br />\r<br />It hasn't happened very often that God has completely zapped my thinking out of nowhere, so I paid attention. It pains me to think of the years of our marriage that I spent trying to change my husband and then punishing him when he wouldn't or couldn't live up to the bar I had set.\r<br />\r<br />I resolved that day to let it go; to focus on his strengths as a husband and leave the weaknesses to God. Of course I slip up more than I'd like, but overall I'd have to say that we're both a lot happier.\r<br />\r<br />Focusing on his patience not his procrastination,\r<br />Jennifer",

      "content": "My husband Mark's father was a piece of work. The town knew him as the county judge. His wife and four kids knew him as an alcoholic who all but ignored them except to fling insults and the occasional fist. As the oldest, Mark took more than his fair share of the abuse.\r<br />\r<br />Mark left for college at 18 and met up with a group of people who led him to Christ. I believe it saved his life. He held on to the idea of a Father who loved him unconditionally and he healed. He even reached a place where he could not only forgive his dad, but build a relationship of sorts with him.\r<br />\r<br />When Mark's dad died in a car wreck four years after Mark left home, each of the kids dealt with it differently. Mark's brother Rick has chosen not to forgive, but rather to whitewash his dad's behavior and pretend things weren't that bad. Rick has followed his dad's footsteps into alcoholism and rage.\r<br />\r<br />Mark's baby sister also chooses to remember only the good. She contends that her dad only abused her siblings--not her. The string of alcoholic, abusive boyfriends tells another story.\r<br />\r<br />And finally, Mark's other sister has chosen a different path completely. She holds on to her anger at her dad with a tight fist. She remembers none of the good and goes over the bad like a well-paged book. Her bitterness spills over into all of her relationships and affects her physical health.\r<br />\r<br />Mark is the only one fortunate enough to understand the power of forgiveness.\r<br />\r<br />\"Do not condemn others, or it will all come back against you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven. Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full--pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back\" (Luke 6:37-38).\r<br />\r<br />Mark gave his forgiveness and in return has lived a life largely free of the bondage his siblings experience. I am so grateful that my marriage and my kids don't have to be on the list of my father-in-law's victims.\r<br />\r<br />I am so grateful Mark chose to forgive.\r<br />\r<br />Freed from the sins of the father,\r<br />Jennifer",

I often think things like, If my husband would just...--fill in the blank with whatever behavior he seems to have missed that particular evening--we would be happy.\r<br />\r<br />I was talking with a friend of mine about this tendency, and she wisely pointed out that perhaps \"analytical\" wasn't the right word to describe my attitude. She wondered if \"judgmental\" might be more apt. Then she said that she was dealing with something similar recently and read Matthew 7:1-5. She wondered if the log the verses refer to is judgment itself. This was new to me. I'd always thought of the log as some huge, unmentionable sin that I would certainly never commit.\r<br />\r<br />But I think she's got a solid point. The log of judgment keeps me from seeing anyone around me clearly. In fact, the log seems to splinter into specks so that everyone I see is somehow contaminated by my judgment.

She can hear you, you know.\" My husband is appalled, but I don't care. We've been looking for a sofa for two months. I've visited this store three times, each time leaving without the information I need. I want to blame someone, and the innocent saleswoman is my target. \r<br />\r<br />As we leave, I feel the tendrils of guilt and regret wrap around my gut. By the time Andrew pulls the car into the driveway, I am in full self-condemnation mode. \r<br />\r<br />I berate myself for days after the furniture store incident. I know God forgives me, I simply cannot forgive myself. The power of my sin grips me with a suffocating stranglehold, like a metal vise around my chest. \r<br />\r<br />Until, that is, I remember that Jesus does not condemn me--that nothing separates me from his love and forgiveness, not even my ugliest sin. \r<br />\r<br />\"So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ,\" Paul writes to the Romans. \"And because you belong to him, the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death\" (Romans 8:1-2).\r<br />\r<br />I know I will sin again, but at the same time, my commitment to Jesus ensures that I am not controlled by my sinful nature (Romans 8:9). Jesus' sacrifice on the cross lifted the power of sin, freeing me not only from unending shame and guilt, but, more importantly, from the strangulating hold of sin on my life. Trusting that I am loved and forgiven by Jesus allows me to live unburdened and at peace, because he promises that sin does not have the final word.\r<br />\r<br />Rachel\r<br /><div><br></div>",
